# SPA 2D Animation Addon

This add-on contains a set of tools that improve the 2D animation workflow in Blender.
It can be used for Storyboarding, 2D Layout and Animation.

Features:
- Easy access to key Grease Pencil features in a single side-panel.
- Peg system: Keyable 2d transforms on layers.
- Material palette system: easily share materials between Grease Pencil objects.
- Image references: Import images as Grease Pencil textured quads.
- Keyframes flipping: Improved keyframe navigation with type filtering.
- Automatic update of world space onion skinning.
- Viewport 2D rotation and mirroring.
- Push/pull objects from active camera view.

Note: This add-on heavily relies on the [Blender SPA](https://github.com/The-SPA-Studios/blender) version.
Most of those features won't work as excepted in vanilla Blender.

The add-on is shared as is, for the community to test, discuss, and hopefully draw inspiration for future Blender versions and tools.
The SPA Studios should not be expected to provide active support for any of the presented features.

To test this add-on separately, download the latest release and install as any Blender add-on (see [documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#installing-add-ons)).
